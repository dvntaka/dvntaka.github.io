Me and 2 other classmates from high school, Zion Basque and Sage Foi, developed this project for the Open category of the 2016 Hawaii Annual Code Challenge- High School division. The motivation for this app was a simple one, even moreso as we were approaching the dreaded time of applying for college, "What do high school students need to succeed in their post-secondary education lives?" The four answers to that question became the basis for Imi Ike.

In a process new to us high school students and under the pressure of under a month-long time frace ,all 3 of us experienced the period of introductions, and later collaboration, with government officials in the first hackathon held by the State of Hawaii. Though I did not take part in the majority of the technical aspects of the project, I was in charge of the crucial search for data throughout the web and the organization of it on spreadsheets. From here, we were able to embed certain sheets on our website, as well as incorporate existing databases of their own, such as Traven Watase ªs Scholars App. 

Though we did not continue with this project, and I was not involved much with the programming, this was my introduction into the world of software development.
