summary: For the final group project in ICS111, I collaborated in the creation of an air hockey simulation.

Our Air Hockey project is a 2-player game constructed using Java and the library EZ Java. Played on one computer, where each player has control over an individual puck's direction in going up, left, down, or right with either the WASD or IJKL keys. Upon getting past the instruction screen, users will be greeted with a rectangular rink and a puck with a starting velocity. The game is won once a player "scores" 7 times by hitting the puck with their paddle into the opposing player's goal.

In this project, I was in charge of the puck class, while my other team members were in charge of the paddle and goal post classes. My work involved keeping the puck moving and the behavior of the puck upon collision with other objects, including the wall, goal area, and paddles. I also took part in debugging and testing my teammates' classes, whenever they needed assistance.

This project was the first to expose me to a collaborative development environment with peers. I was involved with the creative process of brainstorming ideas, narrowing down our focus to those which were feasible with our limited programming experience, and finally going ahead with the vision for our project. Teamwork and communication were a must, and this only strengthed my skills in those areas for the future.
