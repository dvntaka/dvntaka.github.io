When deciding what to create for a final project, me and two other group members brainstormed what are some of the most common issues that we as students face on a daily basis. And the challenge of finding affordable, yet nutritious dietary options appeared, and we agreed that many of our peers are able to empathize with this struggle. Thus, the idea for Make A Meal 2.0 was born.

For this project, I was mostly involved in the process of organizing some of the default data in the database and finding ways to interact with the recipes themselves by their diet types. This involved the process of learning how booleans (whether a recipe is vegan is true or false, etc.) work when interacting with submit forms and checkboxes. From this fundamental block, I then could develop filtering capability, which could sort the recipes by differing diet types.

This was a very good learning process for me, in many realms. I furthered my understanding of Meteor and the use of MongoDB, enhancing my experience with both back-end and front-end work. I learned how to effectively search of documentation when running into issues, and appropriately consult resources whenever issues inevitably arose. However, I also built up soft skills, especially in terms of leadership. My teammates relied on me to get my components of the project done on time, and I on them as well, all of us pushing and assisting each other whenever we came into difficulties.
