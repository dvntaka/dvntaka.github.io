When I was a little kid, I remember the time when I got my first Apple product: an iPod Touch. It was so memorable because in the palm of my hand had everything that I had ever wanted at the time: Internet-on-the-go. Instead of having to access the huge, if somewhat slow HP desktop in my living room, I could download games by touching on this little blue icon called the "App Store", listen to music, message my friends, and perhaps most importantly, watch YouTube videos. Whenver I would use these magical technological devices, I would often wonder what it would be like to actual contribute to this experience with my own creativity and imagination.

I may not be a little kid anymore, but there are still avenues in my mind of innovation and achievement that can be completed with the use of software development. Big Data, and the analysis of it through software, is one field that stands out personally. After all, I feel that it is only through the sifting of huge amounts of data across a wide variety of avenues where patterns can be recognized and the chance of exploitation maximized. Machine Learning could help with this, and it still amazes me to this day that software developed in the late 90s could already dethrone the world's best chess player. In this day and age, programs in AI are only getting scarier and scarier, which makes them more valuable to understand in my eyes. Aside from the serious side of things, however, I also wouldn't mind learning the art of Game Development, such that I could work on (or perhaps compete against) some of my favorite game series of my childhood, such as Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed.

Before I can get to these mountain tops, however, I know that my skills need a lot of work. Despite having been in the computer science program at my university for a year and a half, I still don't feel confident in my ability to program and problem solve. I am only slightly comfortable with one language so far in Java (unless you count pseudocode), and I am not too familiar with the inner workings of operating systems as I would like, such as Linux, or even those which I have used seemingly forever like Windows or MacOS. I hope to develop my proficiency in my capabilies to produce code such that I am able to initiate side projects of my own, as well as advance my comfort in the field of software enginnering, so that I can help create an engineered reality for society.
