When one thinks of the field of Computer Science, they would probably not relate the humanistic quandary of the field of morality and ethics with a subject matter that is "only" about logic and syntax and ...coding. At least, that is what I would think, if I were not exposed to how this growing field is a subset of this millennium's technological revolution, and thus, produces implications that reach all levels of society.

The ethics of software engineers are fundamental principles that hold us accountable in our duty to create content that fosters human good, and limits or prevents the spread of injustice. This is a very broad definition, but this should not require a formal training in philosophy to undergo. As thought leaders in the invention and implementation of tools, software engineers adhering to this code should produce content that add value to peoples lives, respects users' fundamental rights as human beings, and represents the manner in which fellow professionals in other fields may adhere to. Having this standard in mind elicits many challenges, however. A case study I will focus on will help illustrate some of these obstacles, as well as some of the solutions to address them.

In this [article](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e), the author tells his story of working on developing an advertising website for a pharmaceutical company, specifically targeted towards teenage girls. His group is in charge of developing a quiz whose results will determine whether the person taking the quiz should be recommended a specific drug or not. The problem? The requirements to make the quiz always lead to the company's drug being recommended to the user. He was well-aware of this fact, and "didnâ€™t think much of it". Shortly after the completion of the project, he hears from one of his colleague's that a young girl who had taken the drug from the website committed suicide due to its side effects. He shortly resigns from his job thereafter.

There are many ethical factors to be scrutinized in this situation. The author, as the youngest member of his development team and just being satisfied having a full-time job, probably did not feel that it was his capacity question the judgement of his elder colleagues. After all, if everyone else around you, who you consider wiser and more experienced in your field, doesn't voice obvious concern, then it must be a wrong mindset on your part...right? This doesn't mean that there wasn't any ethical adherence related to software engineering. On the contrary, actually. They were mostly likely focused on creating a quality product that represented themselves, their company, and their profession as a whole, well. Who were they to question their customer's request? They are only skilled in programming, not in predicting the implications of a pharmaceutical company's drug, the effects of which they don't know anything about. And so they went on the path of completing their goal. The product was such a success that they were treated to a lavish dinner afterwards (one which the informative colleague did not attend).  

Nonetheless, this doesn't mean that more ethical standards cannot be upheld. No matter what job position we hold, we always have choices, even when it may not seem obvious. Choices on the part of the development company, the project team, and finally the author himself led to the outcome of this incident. Isolating it to the level of the individual, personal autonomy must be remembered in that an individual has the ability to talk to their coworkers and their supervisors about assignments they are uncomfortable with and are questioning. And if this is unproductive, outright refusal is always a last, but available, resort. The author did not even bat an eyelash to the requirements he was helping to create, but if there is ever someone else who is in similar shoes to him, these facts are relevant, and also discredits the excuse of not questioning the development of a skewed quiz result, one that has obvious benefit to the company distributing it and wide-ranging consequences to ordinary people using to it. This is why ethics should not be seen as something so complex; it discounts our judgements, which usually have at least a rough idea of the right thing to do.

Reading this article harkened me back to reading about war crimes, specifically during World War II. At the end of the war, captured Nazi soldiers would say that "I just followed orders" in explanation of their heinous crimes against humanity during that tragic episode in human history. And while software engineers are not soldiers on the front lines, we must not forget that our work affects the welfare of those around us, and this article is hopefully a painful reminder that we can all remember when issues of ethics arrive at our doorsteps.
