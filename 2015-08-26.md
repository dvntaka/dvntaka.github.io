UI Frameworks are some of the most beautiful but jarring things on the planet. For instance, Semantic UI was kicking my butt, to the point where I did not want to do it anymore. I did not have any prior experience with something such as Twitter Bootstrap, but I can only imagine having to go through something like that on my own without a guided environment such as this one. Semantic UI is intuitive by the way that it uses English, which I like. The way that it we can create a menu of items with “ui menu” encapsulating a multiple instances of “ui item” is great. 

This week’s practice WODs I did not turn in by the deadlines, but upon reviewing them in retrospect, I do appreciate the creative freedom associated with it. There was so much to the library that it had me worried that I would have no idea what to do on Thursday. It can definitely be overwhelming, as there is a lot, a lot more memorization involved in understanding all of this; developing algorithms is more reliant on problem solving ability. While going through the Pluralsight lessons, and seeing that a software engineering was teaching it, I thought: “There are people who actually do this for a living?” And while I do understand that there is more to the job title than that, I do give them credit. 

Going through this module, especially when attempting to finish the Island Snow and Murphys assignments, allowed me to greater realize the capabilities of application in what I am learning. Being able to go to any website and possessing the skill to create a fundamental mirror website made by professionals in the field is shocking, but also provides some sense of pride. I hope that going into the next lesson of learning React will only further give me more tools in which to interact with technologies.
